# Scraping
    - Single Time
    - Continuous Updates
    - Data will be coming from multiple sources
    - We need to be able to accomodate information  from various sources
    - Each scraping job should be able to create a first record or add revision to existing record
    - Each revision we should be clearly attribute to the single source
    - Admin/Editorial  team should be able to revise any records
    - Revision system should be available for all the data in the system
    - plan a way to standardize scraping for all the data models from multiple sources
    - Separate the bootstrap data from application data
    - Bootstrap script is a single run script
    - "Data mining script" is a  script that runs frequently and revises the "application data"
