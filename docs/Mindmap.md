# Goal
    - Understand system of government across different dimension
    - Wherever possible make a note
    - Document the list separately of thing if needed for example list of departments
    - Lets outline the ThinkTanks and any of their work that we see to be aligned with us. This way we can decide later if we there is value in bringing all that information to one place or letting it be on their own.
    - Based on research for a week, we shall have a direction as to how we want to approach the OpenGov Project

# Tech Goals    
    - Visualize (This is not a graph, information colleted from the data and put a pretty web page for consumption by the common man)
    - Create a way for people to consume / interact with that information
